## Project Goals

- **CRUD APIs** for managing products, categories, and users.  
- **User Authentication** using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  
- **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination** for efficient product browsing.  
- **Database Optimization** via indexing and query tuning.  
- **API Documentation** with Swagger/OpenAPI for ease of use.
